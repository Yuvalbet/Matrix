# README - SquareMat Project

## Overview ##

This project is focused on implementing a class called `SquareMat` in C++ to handle operations on square matrices of a given size. The goal of the assignment is to support various matrix operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinant calculation, transposition, and more. Additionally, the project includes unit tests using the Doctest library to ensure the correct functionality of the `SquareMat` class and its operations.

### Supported Matrix Operations:
- **Addition** (`+`): Adds two matrices of the same size.
- **Subtraction** (`-`): Subtracts two matrices of the same size.
- **Matrix Multiplication** (`*`): Multiplies two matrices.
- **Element-wise Matrix Multiplication** (`%`): Multiplies two matrices element by element.
- **Division** (`/`): Divides a matrix by a scalar (assuming the scalar is non-zero).
- **Modulo** (`%`): Computes the modulo of each element in the matrix with a scalar.
- **Scalar Multiplication** (`*`): Multiplies a matrix by a scalar.
- **Matrix Exponentiation** (`^`): Raises a matrix to a power.
- **Transposition** (`~`): Computes the transpose of a matrix.
- **Matrix Comparison** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`): Compares matrices of the same size.
- **Matrix operations** (`+=`, `-=`): Performs addition or subtraction with another matrix.

## Files in the Project ##

- **main.cpp**: Contains the main code of the program. This file creates matrices and performs various operations on them.
- **SquareMat.hpp**: Header file that defines the `SquareMat` class along with the operators and functions.
- **SquareMat.cpp**: Implementation file where the `SquareMat` class and its operations are defined.
- **Tests.cpp**: Contains unit tests using Doctest, covering all the operators and functions of the `SquareMat` class.

## Operators in the `SquareMat` Class ##

1. **Addition** (`+`): Allows addition of two matrices of the same size.
2. **Subtraction** (`-`): Allows subtraction of two matrices of the same size.
3. **Matrix Multiplication** (`*`): Performs multiplication of two matrices of compatible sizes.
4. **Element-wise Matrix Multiplication** (`%`): Multiplies corresponding elements from two matrices.
5. **Division** (`/`): Divides a matrix by a scalar (assuming the scalar is non-zero).
6. **Modulo** (`%`): Computes the modulo of each element in the matrix with a scalar.
7. **Scalar Multiplication** (`*`): Multiplies a matrix by a scalar.
8. **Exponentiation** (`^`): Raises a matrix to a power.
9. **Transpose** (`~`): Computes the transpose of the matrix.
10. **Matrix Comparison** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`): Compares matrices of the same size.
11. **Matrix Operations** (`+=`, `-=`): Adds or subtracts a matrix to/from another matrix.

## Key Files ##

1. **SquareMat.hpp**: The header file that defines the class and the operators.
2. **SquareMat.cpp**: The file where the `SquareMat` class functions and operators are implemented.
3. **Tests.cpp**: The file that contains the Doctest unit tests for the operators.

## Running the Program ##

### Makefile

The provided `Makefile` simplifies the process of compiling and running the code. Below is an explanation of each target in the `Makefile`:

1. **`make main`**:
   - This command compiles the main files (`main.cpp`, `SquareMat.cpp`) and creates the executable file `Main`. This file contains the main code for testing various matrix operations.
   - Command:  
     ```bash
     make main
     ```

2. **`make valgrind`**:
   - This command runs the program under the memory analysis tool `valgrind` to check for memory leaks. It helps detect issues with memory management, such as improper memory deallocation or accessing uninitialized memory.
   - Command:  
     ```bash
     make valgrind
     ```

3. **`make test`**:
   - This command runs the unit tests using Doctest. It executes the `Tests.cpp` file and runs all the tests written for the various operators.
   - Command:  
     ```bash
     make test
     ```

4. **`make clean`**:
   - This command cleans up the object files and the executable generated during the compilation process. It helps keep the project directory clean by removing unnecessary files.
   - Command:  
     ```bash
     make clean
     ```

## Summary ##

This project implements a `SquareMat` class that supports various matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and others. The `Makefile` allows for easy compilation and execution of the program, including testing with Doctest and memory leak detection with `valgrind`. All tests are written to ensure that the class and its operators work correctly.
